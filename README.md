### Hi there 👋

# These days

I am the **CTO & Co-Founder** of [Somni Game Studios](https://startupshub.catalonia.com/startup/tarragona/stepland/7417), where we are building a mobile video game around healthy habits — and also proving that you can ship a commercial mobile live-ops game entirely in [Godot](https://godotengine.org).

I am part of the [godot-mobile-plugins](https://github.com/godot-mobile-plugins) organization, where we build open-source Godot plugins that provide unified GDScript interfaces for mobile platforms (Android & iOS).

I created the [Dev Blob](https://diplomaticrobot.github.io/devblob/) blog to post about the challenges we face on this journey.

# Game Jams

* [Unveiled](https://lazarusgamedev.itch.io/unveiled) — A narrative game built in Godot for the **Global Game Jam 2026**. A story about Gwen, choices, and self-discovery.
